# 🌍 ISS Meteorite Visualizer

This project is an interactive 3D visualization of meteorite landings around the world, enriched with predictive data about future meteor showers. Users can explore meteor impacts using a globe interface, and view animated predictions with detailed impact information for each location. It's built with React and `react-globe.gl`, and it enhances engagement with dynamic UI elements like a typing animation and responsive layout.
